# 🧠 Face Disease Detection System

This project is part of my data and AI portfolio. It uses Python and machine learning techniques to build a basic face disease detection model.

## 📌 Problem Statement
To detect skin-related face conditions using a dataset of labeled images and basic ML techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- OpenCV  
- Google Colab  

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Imported and explored the dataset  
2. Resized and normalized face images  
3. Conducted basic data visualization  
4. (Optional) Built a simple CNN model  
5. Evaluated model accuracy  

## 📁 Files
- `face_detection.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook containing code  
- `README.md`: This file  

## ✅ Status
This project is in progress. Modeling and testing are being added.
